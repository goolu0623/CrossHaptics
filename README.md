# CrossHaptics

Reference: https://github.com/ntu-hci-lab/HapticSeer

We modified the OpenVRInputTest with multithread in order to avoid I/O blocking problem.

Steps: 
1. set the arguments if you need to publish things on the reddis channel
2. start the sciprts with release mode and you'll have the data saved in bin/release/console.txt
