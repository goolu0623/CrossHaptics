# CrossHaptics: Enabling Real-time Multi-device Haptic Feedback for VR Games via Controller Vibration Pattern Analysis
![Teaser ver24](https://github.com/goolu0623/CrossHaptics/assets/69243118/f1b1d81d-d925-4439-b277-cbf6dfd47f1d)

## Overview
We presented CrossHaptics, which explores how controller vibration patterns designed by game developers can be used to enable support for additional haptic devices, proposed a framework that automatically detects asymmetrical and symmetrical vibration signals to infer localized vs. full-body haptic events in real-time and provided a plugin architecture to simplify adding support for additional haptic devices.
